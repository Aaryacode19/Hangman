# Hangman
 I made a Hangman game for my project of python🎮. In this game, you need to guess the names of planets in our solar system. 🪐 You have 6 lives to guess the right letters. ❤️ If you guess correctly, you win! 🎉 If you guess wrong too many times, the hangman gets hung. 😱 Try to guess the planet before you run out of lives! 🤔💫
